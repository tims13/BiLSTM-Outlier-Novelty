They did not include a plug for the computer! It's useless and my only option is to return it or buy a plug???!!!! Insane
"Awesome build quality with nice sleek plastic and aluminum materialsInsane gaming performance ( gtx 1060 max q, i5 7300, 8gb RAM etc...) for the price especiallyThe best cooling you can probably get with max q 1060 laptops out thereSilent when running meager tasks such as browsing youtube, watching streams using it for anything other than video gamesSSD reads pretty wellDesign is more accessible compared to most other gaming laptopsCons:Fans can get loud when playing games but not really an issue when you use headphones etc...A bit heavier than I expected for a maxq laptop but not a huge issueThere are better sales on the dell website although they are periodic and not scheduled so pay attention"
"is dank, didn by it doe"
"One week in and I am very satisfied with this little laptop. My primary objective for this purchase was to have a small portable laptop that was still powerful enough to do some fairly heavy multitasking between online browsing, streaming and microsoft office. This little machine has been more than sufficient and has actually been able to keep pace a little better than my work issue desktop machine. I find myself building out complicated excel files with ease while having 2-5 webpages and a couple streaming video players open at the same time no problem. I highly recommend this laptop, even more so when you factor in the cost"
"- Good-enough performance for, web browsing, emails, comparison shopping, light productivity (docs, sheets, slides).- Typing is okay, strong merits to its smooth metal curves around the entirety of the laptop (except below the ports). Feels wonderful beneath the palms.- 3:2 aspect ratio, offers a taller screen.**PlayStore (android apps), as of 08/07/2017,Beta as software term implies, are yet to perform as intended.For apps (you may experience occasional crashing and or screen freezing requiring power down to reset, problems may vary from device to device).YouTube app, download feature, with subscription, works.Chromebooks seem promising, optimistic of further improvements!**"
Super slim and light perfect for backpack to school. Nice screen. Windows version of MacBook Air
"Minus the bloatware that has to be manually removed by the user, this laptop does everything. It runs a lot of the games I love playing (League, TERA, Overwatch) at surprisingly good frames for the price (Almost always 50-60FPS)I have the i5 version as well, so for games that could really utilize the multi-threading capabilities of the i7, I can imagine it could be even better.Would definitely recommend to anyone looking into an affordable gaming laptop that doubles as a work station"
I’ve had problem after problem with mine
"My wife loves it so far, and so do I."
I bought this for a Christmas present 2017 and it has stop working in March of 2018. Do not purchase this
My computer came with a bad battery
It'sa good laptop. Fast and stable
beastly laptop. i love this thing. great price/quality ratio
"I purchased this for a friend and now I'm jealous. I love the Chrome platform and I would get one myself if I could get one equipped with a much larger hard drive. I currently use the Chrome browser in my Windows 10 laptop. It's super quick and a lot more reliable.Update: 2 weeks later. Still running like a champ. My friend went to this from a 7"" tablet because, well, we're all getting older and the eyes don't see as good as before. Bigger screen, easy to see. This is more or less a large tablet with a keyboard. I like the fact that we didn't need to get any security software to protect it, Google seems to have that under control"
"The laptop itself is good. High performance but the problem is its not an ""Intel i7 7th Gen"". Another Problem is the battery drains so fast when playing games such as DoTa2. The Built-In Fan (im so sorry i dont know what you called that) seems not working properly unless you make the back side of the laptop elevated. The speakers is good and i have no problem with that. The black version is easy to scratch and your finger prints will be surely all over once you touched it. The graphics is good, it perfectly runs games smoothly.My sugesstion is buy this PC if youre an MMORPG gamer or an FPS. Dont buy this if you love to play MOBA games, because an regular match on MOBA games last 60 min and it will already drain 40% - 50% of your battery.*I lost my old amazon account thats why you cant see the verified purchase logo (or something)*"
I hate this thing..... I should have bought a DELL!!!! Had it 2 or 3 months and it has stoped work I working now... Just a spinning wheel of dots..... POS
"Good performance, portability, display and wifiOther pros:Quiet fan even under loadMatte display works well, has good viewing angles, and remains fairly color-accurate, if not exceptionally brightCons:Keyboard is not great (rattles, bounces, feels cheap)Webcam is garbageFeels like all-plastic construction, though I was under the impression it was metalSomewhat flimsy chassis"
"Very great affordable gaming laptop. The specs don’t lie. For the price of this laptop, its hard to get much more than what this laptop provides, I have yet to run into a game it can’t play and its remarkably fast and is also fashionable"
MY granddaughter is happy with it =)
It quit turning on ppl
"First of all, for the money, Acer computers just can't be beat. They have a reasonable amount of storage and they are capable of basic computing. But it you are expecting $5000 laptop performance, you will be disappointed. I have this laptop to take to my summer home so that I don't need to carry my laptop back and forth every time. It is great for emails, internet and basic computing. I think the speed and some of the capabilities would frustrate someone who uses it for work or something that requires a lot of capacity. For what it is, though, it is a bargain"
so far i really love the laptops performance for the price paid
I am using around 3 week... speed of window is terrible.... I never recommend this product..Maybe.. this computer was made in secondition world wAR not 2017
"First time using chrome wanted windows 10 but haven't had to use my phone anymore and I no longer charge then since this helps me do everything I need at light speed! Been playing games on it non stop while streaming videos and it just blends if u multi tasking and are addicted to YouTube like myself....it's a powerful laptop for a Chromebook I've run multiple pages in HD videos streaming with very minimal lag (due to area of internet). But what I love the most is the charger which is very important as to how long ur laptop will last, not only is it super fast at charging but it is delicate and easy to plug in and it pops off as a safety mechanism I believe...either way it never overheats it charges really fast even during heavy use and it has options to really dim down the screen to save energy. It's like a tablet but you can do way more and run apps with easy... A must have if you like to entertain your family or others as the speakers on this babe are crisp and clear. It's also light and it comes with this cool bubble wrapping packaging that I've been using in between my lap and the laptop and for storage . My fav thing about this is it's taken over my use or cravings to even use a mobile or smartphone/iPhone which is only explained by how easy it is to get everything social media done on a Chromebook while I do plan to get a Dell that runs windows 10 this is really good to save ur other devices from the load social media and YouTube can out on a device built to run more complex programs. So get one for sure and forget about charging ur phone and looking like a boy who can out down his Gameboy lol jk"
"Initially I bought this through Amazon but cancelled quickly when I realized Microsoft offers a student discount. So far I have had this 2 days and it has not been bad but it certainly has not been great either. I don't think I had Windows 10 S for an hour before I quickly upgraded it Windows 10 Pro. As stated before Windows 10 S will NOT let you install 3rd party applications unless they are in the Microsoft store. So that means you are stuck with limited VPN options, Edge Browser, and a ton of other limitations. The trade off is real and significant. For Windows 10 Pro you can install the programs you want; however rest assured your battery life will suffer tremendously. I was at 100% about 20 minutes ago but after moderate use (no streaming videos or music) I am down to 92%. I think it is fair to say Windows 10 Pro kills the battery life Microsoft touted as being amazing. Microsoft informs users that you can downgrade back to Windows 10 S if you choose free of charge. The touch screen is nice as is the material surrounding the keyboard. The screen resolution is absolutely on point. I have the i5 8GB 256 GB model and I have to say it is much slower than I anticipated. It looks like many others are reporting the same thing. I'm not sure the more expensive i7 would make that much of a difference. In addition, the facial recognition software to unlock your computer is inconsistent at best and I could totally see myself strictly using the pin procedure to access if it keeps up its shenanigans. All and all it is a good attempt by Microsoft, does it beat it's Macbook Air counterpart? In my opinion, no. As I am deeply entrenched in both ecosystems, Apple and Microsoft (I love both) I can say with the utmost confidence that it is a good computer but not great and certainly not worth the hefty $1299 price tag."

easy to put in a ssd in place of the hdd
Very nice price and having 16gb of ram was important
I didn't get a a charger with my orderI'm not if that's just how they do things but I felt it was worth saying
Muy bien
As stated in other reviews initial updates took unbelievably long to finish now so far so good I personally hate win 10 but the computer seems good for the money spent
Great! Only problem is it doesn't have an hdmi outlet
"At first sight is pretty! but I dont know why the mouse and screen paralized like for 6 seconds and then suddenly starts working again, IT IS STARTING TO WORRY ME,,, when Im watching youtube videos, it paralyzes and I have to close the page... makes me really mad, please... what can I do? I didnt download anything, the first time I turned on it happened!!!!! HELP"
"Don't rely on this computer for anything. It is only about 3 months old and freezes or goes to blue screen almost half the time I use it. I have had it looked at by 2 techs not including the Dell tech team. The Dell tech was very nice and she connected to my computer to try to find the problem or problems. She told me to keep a log to document any more anomalies. Here are the results from 10-25-17 to 11-15-17: 4 blue screens in 2 days, 7 more blue screens after that for a total of 11, and 1 freeze. That's 12 anomalies in 22 days. It was protected by Norton, In short, No more Dells for me. But if your favorite color is blue and you have all the time in the world to waste on a very poor lap top, then go for it .But remember you get what you pay for and with Dell, a lot less. 0 stars would be more accurate. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to shop for a new HP... Mike"
Super Fast for the Price!!! Yee Haw!....I live in KY
"No, buy something faster. Wish I'd returned it before the opportunity passed me by"
is good but needs more memory in C
"Awesome laptop but 2 week after I got it, the laptop stop charging"
Very bad shape used. And locked to someone else account. I throw it away
"Excellent! Use it daily for my remote job. Functions fast and efficiently! Screen is large 15"" with great graphics. In general ""Love it!! """
"Satisfais de mon achat,j'ai changer mon hhd 1tb pour 1tb ssd,et jai ajouter 32gb de ram de meilleur qualiter tous se qui conserne la qualiter des composer systeme dorgine est cheap mes pour le prix de reventes des pieces pour des nouvelles en vos le coup"
"Excelente producto!!. Tenia miewo, pues todos los comentarios hacia la marca y hasta del modelo no eran alentadoras. Pero muy buen producto"
"Great laptop, got all I needed and a bargain price too"
No because I couldn't download
"I am switch from Macbook retina, and I noticed that the surface laptop is must lighter and Windows 10 run very smoothly on this laptop.I have a gaming laptop that has much better specs but feels slower than this one.The only problem is that the plastic touchpad is not as good as mac"

I like the pc it is usable for any website but note it is slower than normal pc .after all this is the cheapest pc u can pins and note :downloading files or games are not a option.if u want to play games steam games are technically not a option if it is lower than 5 gb because even though the pc have 32 gb it have literally 25 gb for the settings so u can barely download anything on maximum 3 gaming app is lucky I can’t barely even download 1 game on it so if u are looking for gameing not recommended but if cheapest and usable for searching that does not require downloading it is recommended
"nice device, using it daily"
I don't know. I've bought ASUS systems from amazon in the past and they were the bomb. This one was brand new outta the box. It lasted 2 hours and the HD died while transfering files. I decided to go back to an HP
does what I bought it for. Watching old family films on CD
"Great laptop , same item description , very fast . Graphic is high - ultra for all 2017-2018 games with no lagFifa 18, bf1, gta v , pes 18 , AC:O"
Pros- Overall pretty fast performance mode is about 3.5 GHZRuns games smoothlyCONs the battery drains insanely fast.Will sometimes lag too much for an i7
Battery life is the worst
i have a problem whit touchpad
i bought this. it's just 1050
The computer is pretty new to me. You can not tell it is a refurbo one. The configuration is good enough for daily use. And the price is incredible
came to me with language i could not use sent back to company
"Its a cheaper gaming laptop, but the materials its poor quality my oil fingerprints gets so easy on the lids , the display looks good but probably it's need more deep colors . Comes.woth GTX 1050 4G Ti but no VR you can spend 150 dollars more and get some laptop with Gtx 1060 and VR"
Definitely enjoy. However the transfer of data from my other computer has been time consuming
Perfect 2 in 1
"First off, for about $750 I do not believe you can beat this at all. I am not totally sure what SSD was ""supposed"" to come with this unit but my unit came with an Intel 600p pci-e SSD, to me to have an SSD of that class is great especially at this price point, while it is not the best, its better than a sata version, it also came with 8 gb ddr4 2400 MHZ ram. The screen is not perfect but it is still very nice. To get a 1050 Ti 4 gb, a true 7th gen quad core, a 1080p IPS display, and usb-c it is top notch. This is by no means a high end gaming rig, that is what my Ryzen 7 and GTX 1070 are for. This is great for a second computer or work machine to get work done and being able to game on the go as well. Power, speed, and features wise, this is as powerful as most regular desktops, if you are in the market do not hesitate to buy this. In my opinion anything more powerful should probably be a dedicated desktop anyways"
"This was the worst Dell laptop I ever bought. Within 3 months, I had the keyboard stop working. I had their tech people work on it for hours and it hasn't been right ever since. They claim it's the software which is not their problem. I think the girl took off things that weren't supposed to be removed. I have hardly used it. It blacks out after an hour or so. I have to take it to a repair shop soon. Wasted my money here.I have always had Dell and never had trouble with them. got to be this model"
Works super
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He travels quite a bit and has to meet a lot of remote clients. The laptop fits perfectly in his back pack and connects well to various wifi networks
I Love It !!! Good Price & Came Right In time Before Finals
No tiene entrada lan
my asus does not read read cd's only Rom and i bought it in April 2018 thinking it is varranty for a year but not so. i really like to return it tbut amazon says return return deadline is closed closed.
sucked only used it for 1 week then it wouldnt turn on properly it went on a loop
"I was searching for a small computer to run Windows as all other computers I have are Mads. From price perspective I was consideringByte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage). Then I find that ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage may be a better choice since is a full notebook, light and portable. My concerns were about ability to run MS Office application on a Windows 10 platform, flash storage limitations and graphic performance becauseI will use this machine mostly in a desktop configuration using a LG wide format monitor 2560X1080. Well, when arrived, the machine was nice and small. I goth through the pains of installing MS Office at a very slow pace. Then, with Windows 10, MS Office and all other software that the machine came with I got very much to the end of the flash drive space at about 28Gb out of 32 Gb total. It was s solution for that as I tried option to compress the drive in the setting. Voila, Local Disk (C:) shows 12.6 Gb free of 28.3 Gb. Everything works flawlessly, I am so impressed and amazed with the capabilities of a $200 laptop that can do so much for so little price. Of course, other people may find limitations, however, it is a perfect choice for my special purpose of running MS Office mostly in the office with a large monitor and use it as a notebook occasionally when on the road. I highly recommend it to anyone that need a cheap, portable Windows 10 machine.ASUS E200HA Portable Lightweight 11.6-inch Intel Quad-Core Laptop, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage, Windows 10 with 1 Year Microsoft Office 365 Subscription"
the accounting department approves
All is good. New and fresh laptop straight from factory
Awful the item was badly damage
nice product and useful for my kids for their activities
